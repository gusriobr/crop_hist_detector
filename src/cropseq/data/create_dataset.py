Reads the sample points and the mapping file and creates the final sequence dataset.
Input files:
- resources/code_mapping.xlsx: datatame with one column per year that maps the codes of that eyar with the reference year (last = 2021)
- resources/samples_sequence.pickle: panda dataframe with one row per each sample point (aprox 2M points) and one column per each 
year with the code of the detected land usage in that point for the year of the column.
Output file:
- resources/dataset.pickle: pandas dataframe with the points from the samples_sequence.pickle with the codes of each year
converted to reference year land usage codes.
